This repository aims at collecting tools and documentation to provide Cyber Deception [[[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8328971][1]],[[https://medium.com/dataseries/what-really-is-cyber-deception-e60dd33e9e41][2]]] service in *FLUIDOS*.

The Cyber Deception service currently relies on the features offered by the *Decepto* tool, which is a system that creates decoys as clones of existing services.

Given an application graph (sets of micro-services and data-flows across them) Decepto decides the services to clone as decoys and where to deploy them based on optimization metrics such as the availability of resources.

As shown in the below picture it runs in a Kubernetes cluster and could use multiple external algorithms to take decisions and perform actions.

Decepto is being defined with a fully open approach, which facilitates the participation of actors that are outside the FLUIDOS community. Current implementation is available at [[https://gitlab.fbk.eu/cyber-deception/decepto]].
