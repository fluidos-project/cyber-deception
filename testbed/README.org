* Testbed

This testbed simulates a multi-region FLUIDOS deployment. It consists of three FLUIDOS nodes (k8s cluster) simulating a provider and two consumers and composed by two k8s nodes each:

- =consumer-control-plane=
- =consumer-worker=
- =provider-italy-control-plane=
- =provider-italy-worker=
- =provider-germany-control-plane=
- =provider-germany-worker=

The setup is intended for testing the creation of a bigger (10k+ nodes) infrastructure of FLUIDOS-based federation and multi-cluster orchestration.

* Install requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- =kubectl= (Client Version: v1.32.2)
- =liqoctl= (Client version: v1.0.0)

You can install the requirements using the following links:

- kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
- liqoctl: https://docs.liqo.io/getting-started/installation/

* Setup testbed

To set up the testbed environment, execute the `setup-testbed.sh` script:

#+begin_src bash
./setup-testbed.sh
#+end_src

This script will:

- Create three FLUIDOS nodes using KinD
- Install Liqo and FLUIDOS components on every nodes
- Configure the control planes for the consumer and providers
- Establish interconnections and peering between regions using Liqo

After completion, you will have a simulated multi-region FLUIDOS testbed ready for experimentation.

* Teardown testbed

To remove the testbed and clean up all associated resources, run:

#+begin_src bash
./teardown.sh
#+end_src
